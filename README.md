# Valiu Liquidity Network API

A high level HTTP API for client applications to easily interact with the services built around the [VLN blockchain](https://github.com/valibre-org/node).  
It's developed as a collection of plugins run with [Valor](https://github.com/valibre-org/valor), our open runtime to create awesome decentralizable APIs that allows Rust and Javascript plugins to be run seamlessly in a server as well as a browser environment.  
Focus is on simplicity of use for front-end applications, hidding away the complexities of underlying systems like blockchain transactions and secret key management.
